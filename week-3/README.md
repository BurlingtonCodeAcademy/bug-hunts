# Bug Hunt Unit-3 HTML and CSS

## Welcome

Welcome to this week's bug hunt on HTML and CSS!

## Introduction

For this week's bug hunt you are tasked to find a way to resize the picture of the Kitty, and to use the `blue-back.png` as a background image.

Please use CSS for both of these tasks, and avoid using different images from another location.
