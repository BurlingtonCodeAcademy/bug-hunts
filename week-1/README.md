# Welcome to my Fantastic Command Line Calculator Application!

## It takes numbers, and adds them up, telling you the total at the end! Any Number of Numbers!

### Or at least it's supposed to...

The desired behavior for this program is to have it ask a user for a number, and continue asking the user for numbers, until they tell it they are done at which point it outputs the sum total of all numbers entered.

Currently this program has quite a few bugs. The purpose of this exercise is to fix all the bugs, get the program running, and learn to recognize a few common JavaScript mistakes.

* Try running the program by entering `node add-em-up.js` into the terminal from inside this directory
* Read the stack trace and try to figure out what's wrong in the code
* The line that throws the error might not be the main source of the bug, but it's a hint. So is the error message
* Once you've solved one error, run the program again. There are many bugs in this code so fixing one error will reveal another
* Not every bug will cause the code to error out. Many of them simply cause the program to behave... oddly
